" General: {
    set autowrite " Write automatically when :make, :next etc...
    set autoread " Reload file when it has been changed externally.
    set nobackup " No need for .bkp files when version control exist.
    set nowritebackup " If Vim crashes often then turn backups on again, look at docs for more information.
    set noswapfile " Don't create swap files, nowadays we should have enough memory to store a text file.
    set complete-=i " Completion list for all included files is a bad idea, scanning could take a while.
    set sessionoptions-=options " Don't store options (global variables etc...) when making a session.

    set undodir=~/.vim/.vim_undoes " Where do we store all this awesomeness?!?!
    set undofile " Persistent undos are completely freaking awesome!!!

" }

" Autocompletions: { Basically, Vim's built-in auto-completions support with uniform keyboard shortcuts.
    " We are using VimCompletesMe as the plugin of choice for making Vim's " built-in autocompletions be
    " more uniformly handled with an single key: <Tab> and <Shift>-<Tab>. It will attempt to derive what
    " the most suitable autocompletion function is to be called based on the context (omni, user etc...)
    set omnifunc=syntaxcomplete#Complete " Enables only the default Vim auto-completion (quite fast!!!).
    " The above autocompletion types will not call any external programs (it might however, call ctags).
    set completeopt+=longest " Attempts to insert longest obviously current common match found so far.
    set completeopt-=preview " Sometimes the [Scratch] preview window will pop-up. We don't want that.
    let g:vcm_direction='p' " First choice should be the *closest* matching entry (as Bram intended).
" }

" Formatting: {
    set expandtab " Expand tab characters to space characters.
    set shiftwidth=4 " One tab is now 4 spaces.
    set shiftround " Always round up to the nearest tab.
    set tabstop=4 " This one is also needed to achieve the desired effect.
    set softtabstop=4 " Enables easy removal of an indentation level.

    set autoindent " Automatically copy the previous indent level. Don't use smartindent!!!
    set backspace=indent,eol,start " Used for making backspace work like in most other editors
    set wrap " Wrap text. This is also quite optional, replace with textwidth=80 is you don't want this behaviour.
    set lazyredraw " Good performance boost when executing macros, redraw the screen only on certain commands.
    set showcmd
" }

" Searching: {
    set ignorecase " Search is not case sensitive, which is usually what we want.
    set smartcase " Will override some ignorecase properties, when using caps it will do a special search.
    set incsearch " Enables the user to step through each search 'hit', usually what is desired here.
    set hlsearch " Will stop highlighting current search 'hits' when another search is performed.
    set magic " Enables regular expressions. They are a bit like magic (not really though, DFA).

    " Ack and Ag are incredibly useful for searching really fast, forget slow IDE searching.
    if executable('ag') " The Silver Searcher, faster than 'ack' (mostly)
        let g:ackprg = 'ag --vimgrep' " Enables ag compat. with vim.
    endif " Will use 'ag' if exists, otherwise uses normal Ack.
" }

" Interface: {
    set ffs=unix,dos,mac " Prioritize unix as the standard file type.
    set encoding=utf-8 " Vim can now work with a whole bunch more characters (powerline too).
    set scrolloff=8 " The screen will only scroll when the cursor is 8 characters from the top/bottom.
    set foldmethod=indent " Pressing zc will close a fold at the current indent while zo will open one.
    set foldopen+=jump " Additionally, open folds when there is a direct jump to the location.

    set wildmenu " Enable the 'autocomplete' menu when in command mode (':').
    set shortmess=at " Shorten some command mode messages, will keep you from having to hit ENTER all the time.
    " set cmdheight=2 " Might decrease the number of times for hitting enter even more, double default height.
    set stal=2 " Always show the tab lines, which makes the user interface a bit more consistent.

    set showmatch " Will highlight matching brackets.
    set mat=2 " How long the highlight will last.
    set number " Show line numbers on left side.
    set relativenumber " Enables the user to easily see the relative distance between cursor and target line.
    set ttyfast " Will send characters over a terminal connection faster. We do have fast connections after all.
    set ruler " Always show current cursor position, which might be needed for the character column location.
    set hidden " Abandon buffer when closed, which is usually what we want to do in this case.

    syntax on " The most important feature when coding. Vim please bless us with this option right now!.
    set laststatus=2 " Always have a status line, this is required in order for Lightline to work correctly.
    set noshowmode " Disables standard -INSERT-, -NORMAL-, etc... Lightline will provide a better looking one for us.
    set t_Co=256 " This will 'force' terminals to use 256 colors, enabling Lightline and the colorscheme to look correct.
    set background=light " Cool programmers only use dark themes. It's good for your eyes man, really nice!
